# High Win Rate Forex Trading with Reinforcement Learning

AI-powered trading system using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for XAUUSD M15 trading.

## Current Training Status (Dec 22, 2025)

🔄 **Balanced RR v2 Training In Progress** - 23% complete (344K/1.5M timesteps)

| Metric | Train | Validation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Win Rate | 51.2% | 47.7% |
| Profit Factor | - | 0.91 |
| Trades | ~65/episode | - |
| No Improvement | - | 17 epochs |

Training is exploring but hasn't found improvement yet. Model is learning trade execution but validation metrics need work.

## Previous Best Results (High WR v7)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Rate | 80.5% |
| Total Trades | 2,754 |
| Timeframe | M15 |
| Symbol | XAUUSD |
| TP/SL Ratio | 1:4 |

## Strategy

The model uses a **small TP / large SL** approach:
- Take Profit: 0.5 × ATR
- Stop Loss: 2.0 × ATR

This asymmetric risk/reward achieves high win rate by:
- Taking quick profits on small moves
- Allowing trades room to recover before stopping out
